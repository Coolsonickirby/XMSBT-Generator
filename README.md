you need Python3 and dotnet 2.0/3.0 (not sure which one)

extract all msbts from the data.arc and put it in the msbts folder

give it a path to your mods folder and it'll auto-generate xmls and place em in the
mod folder it found the msbt in

to run this, open up cmd and type
`python generate.py`
or
`python3 generate.py`
or
`py generate.py`
